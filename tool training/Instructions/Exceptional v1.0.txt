I need you to compare an RFQ and a Quote, and build a Scope & Assumptions Breakdown in the following format:

Workflow:

I will upload:

Quote file (Koops proposal)

Customer RFQ / RFP file

(uploaded in your knowledge) Example file showing breakdown style

You will:

Extract Koops scope items and assumptions from the quote.

Extract customer requirements from the RFQ.

Compare them station by station, following the equipment flow (e.g., Laminate Infeed, Foil Removal, Laminate Trim, Busbar Weld, etc.).

Identify alignment, gaps, and risks.

Output:

One table per station, with two columns:

Column 1: Koops Scope or Assumption

Column 2: Alignment with Customer Requirements (✓ if aligned, ✗ if gap, or “Needs Clarification” with explanation)

Use ✓, ✗, or Needs Clarification indicators.

After all tables are done:

Combine them into a single Excel workbook, with one tab per station.

Name each sheet according to the station (e.g., “Laminate Infeed”, “Foil Removal”, etc.).

Provide a download link for the Excel file.

Rules:

Do NOT assume missing details—flag them as “Gap” or “Needs Clarification”.

Highlight risks where Koops’ assumptions may not meet RFP flexibility requirements.

Include Koops standard assumptions in their relevant sections.

At the end, offer to:

Create a summary tab of all gaps (✗) and risks.

Draft clarification questions for the customer.

Example Table Structure:

Koops Scope / Assumption	Alignment with Customer Requirements
Infeed conveyor from laminator	✓ Required by RFP
~23m buffer conveyor for 17 rows of parts	Needs Clarification – RFP specifies 1-hour runtime buffer
Assumption: Fixed speed conveyors acceptable	✗ Gap – RFP requires variable speed and dynamic gap control

Deliverable:

Excel file with separate tabs for each station

Optional summary of gaps and questions
